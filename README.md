## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to have a uniform yet playful feel, with warm and rich block colours and accent colours dotted all over the web pages. This was done to portray the atmosphere that the user can expect when visiting the cafe.

### Colour Scheme
To choose a colour scheme, I used a coolors to generate a palette
<!--Insert doc of color scheme screenshots-->

### Fonts
I mostly used sans-serif font-families.

The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a brief introduction section and two columned section of news about the cafe.
- An about page with customer reviews and a section about the owners.
- A menu page
